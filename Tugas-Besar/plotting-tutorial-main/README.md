# Plotting Tutorial

This repository contains basic plotting tutorial using Matplotlib in Python. We use Jupyter Notebooks for writing the plotting scripts.

## Example files

### Data

- gr.bands.gnu:
This file contains electronic energy bands for graphene

- gr.dos:
This file contains density of states (DOS) for graphene


### Notebooks

- plot-ebands.ipynb:
for plotting energy bands

- plot-dos.ipynb:
for plotting DOS

- plot-merge.ipynb:
for combining the energy bands and DOS in one figure
